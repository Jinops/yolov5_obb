This repository is forked from [yolov5_obb](https://github.com/hukaixuan19970627), which is a custom model of YOLOv5 using oriented bounding boxes.

To use the model in my environment below, I encountered several issues.

After troubleshooting, I documented the issues and modifications of codes on the Wiki.

## Environment

- Windows 10
- Python 3.10
- cuda toolkit 11.8 (11.3+ required)
- cuda driver 12.2
- GeForce RTX 3060
